# My Personal Project---- TodoList

## About application
The application is to help people to do *a work list schedule*, it will add tasks into their list and make them clearly 
know what they should do next. It is useful for the people who need to assign their tasks. The reason why I am interested 
in this application is that there are many works we should do in the whole project or just in work of one day, for me I 
always need to re-schedule my own tasks, so I think we need a more quick application to **show what I need to do at next 
step.**
